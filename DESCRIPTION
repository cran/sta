Description: Efficiently estimate shape parameters of periodic time series 
    imagery (raster stacks) with which  a statistical seasonal trend analysis (STA) 
    is subsequently performed. STA output can be exported in conventional raster formats. 
    Methods to visualize STA output are also implemented as well as the calculation 
    of additional basic statistics. STA is based on (R. Eastman, F. Sangermano, 
    B. Ghimire, H. Zhu, H. Chen, N. Neeti, Y. Cai, E. Machado and S. Crema, 2009) <doi:10.1080/01431160902755338>.
